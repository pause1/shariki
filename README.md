# Kulki
###### The balls / Шарики / Shariki
 One of the first serious projects I made for my upper secondary school. It represents Jarosław Lewandowski's Microsoft Windows game "Kulki", which were a variant of another, yet older game Шарики. It was my first real attempt to make my thoughts working as code. 
 I am aware that it's messy, duplicates a lot of work which could be done by class, simple function, recursion or whatever other approach using modern JavaScript build-in methods, yet when my only experience with programming was console.loggin `foo` `bar` or printing some simple arithmetic operations to cpp console I was pretty proud I made it work as it does. 
 
 Graphics are taken from the original Lewandowski's game "Kulki". It was released under Freeware license, so I believe its not entirely legal to use it for commercial use. This project has been made purely for educational purposes and I had no financial gain from it.
